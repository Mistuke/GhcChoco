    <summary>GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment for the functional language Haskell.</summary>
    <description>Highlights: 
            • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions. 
            • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM). 
            • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. 
            • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform. 
            • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation. 
            • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs. 
            • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling. 
            • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage. </description>
